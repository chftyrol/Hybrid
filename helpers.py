'''
    This module contains the definition of a few helper classes and functions used by Hybrid.
    
    Most of the contents of this module are simple classes like Action, Link etc. used to represent structured data types and nothing more.
    A few custom exceptions are also defined.

    There are also a couple of methods not belonging to any class, such as the Hybrid utterance generator.

        The DEFAULT section in that file it propagated to all sections.
        Having this information hardcoded provides a safe way to operate on the machine services, especially when using systemd units instead of custom scripts.
        This is because stuff from the client (presumably unsafe) is never directly written in a command.
        Instead we write content from this list's items and its members.

        serviceConfFile Syntax:
            Name: the name of the service
            Description: a description of what the service does
            AllowedActions: a comma separated list of the actions that can be performed to the service. 
                The only acceptable values here are: start, stop, restart, enable, disable and navigate.
            MeasureMethod: one of the following (case insensitive keys):
                'systemd' : status of the service should be measured by checking the status of a systemd unit, specified by MeasurementInstrument
                'systemd-user' : status of the service should be measured by checking the status of a user systemd unit, specified by MeasurementInstrument
                'Script' : the status of the service should be measured by running a custom script, which full path is specified in MeasurementInstrument
            MeasurementInstrument: if MeasureMethod is either 'systemd' or 'systemd-unit' this must be a systemd unit (a user one in case of 'systemd-unit')
                                   if MeasureMethod is 'Script' this is the full path of the custom script. Said script when run should return a string in the form:
                                        "<A> <E>"
                                    where <A> can be: active, inactive, unknown
                                    and <E> can be: enabled, disabled, unknown.
            ActionMethod: same as MeasureMethod, but specify the way we will be operating on the service
            MeasurementInstrument : if MeasureMethod is either 'systemd' or 'systemd-unit' this must be a systemd unit (a user one in case of 'systemd-unit')
                                    if MeasureMethod is 'Script' this is the full path of the custom script. Said script should do the following:
                                        - start the service when passed the arg 'start'
                                        - stop the service when passed the arg 'stop'
                                        - restart the service when passed the arg 'restart'
                                        - enable the service when passed the arg 'enable' (if applicable)
                                        - disable the service when passed the arg 'disable' (if applicable)
