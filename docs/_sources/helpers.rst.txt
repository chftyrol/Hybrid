Synopsis
^^^^^^^^
This module contains the definition of a few helper classes and functions used by ``Hybrid``.

Most of the contents of this module are simple classes like ``Action``, ``Link`` etc. used to represent structured data types and nothing more.
A few custom exceptions are also defined.

There are also a couple of methods not belonging to any class, such as the hybrid utterance generator.
