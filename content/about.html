  <h2>What's this?</h2>
  <p>
    This is a web application used to control Hybrid, chftyrol's home server. The server runs on a Raspberry Pi and runs many services. 
    For performance reasons having many services running at once is not auspicable. The main purpose of this application is to be able to switch on and off services
    in a simple and accessible way.
  </p>
  <h2>Who the hell is chftyrol?</h2>
  <p>
    I am.
  </p>
  <h2>Why the name Hybrid?</h2>
  <p>
    Well, it turns out that I am one heck of a Battlestar Galactica fan. 
    My machines are given names of notable humanoid cylons (i.e. <i>skinjobs</i>). 
    The Hybrid has a very special role amongst cylons, and this home server is particularly suited to bear that name.
  </p>
  <p>
    The moral of this story is: if you haven't already, watch Battlestar Galactica! Don't be frightened by the sci-fi name. Watch it.
    And then let's talk about it, if you'd like.
